# Petlove

Petlove is a web application designed for dog and cat owners and future owners to connect, share, and care for their pets. The project consists of a user-friendly interface with multiple pages, each serving a specific purpose.

- Home page: serves as the entry point for users, providing an overview of the app’s features and functions.
- News page: contains a collection of articles and updates related to animals.
- Our friends page: contains a list of partners.
- Profile page: displays the user’s personal information, including name, profile picture, and pet information.
- Add pet page: allows users to create a profile for their dog or cat, including information such as name, breed, age, and health information.

The user has the ability to authorize (register, log in and log out) and search for their pet by filter.

The work was done using the Vite bundler on React, Redux for state management, React Router for routing and Tailwind CSS for styling. The Axios library is used for queries. Responsive design for different devices.
